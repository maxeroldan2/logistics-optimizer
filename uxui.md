### Container Form Redesign
**Implementation**: Complete redesign of the Add/Edit Container form modal to match modern design specifications.

**Design Changes**:
- **Header**: Updated title to "Add New Container" with descriptive subtitle "Define the space you'll be shipping with."
- **Two-Column Layout**: 
  - Left column: Container name, icon selector, and capacity/dimensions in 2x2 grid
  - Right column: Logistics & timing fields with prominent calculated volume display
- **Volume Card**: Added blue-themed calculated volume card with calculator icon, showing real-time m³ calculations
- **Action Bar**: Redesigned bottom actions with proper spacing:
  - Load Preset (left, outlined button)
  - Save as Preset (center, outlined button)  
  - Add Container (right, primary blue button)

**Technical Implementation**:
- Refactored `ContainerFormRefactored.tsx` with cleaner component structure
- Added real-time volume calculation with `useEffect` hook
- Improved responsive design with `grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2`
- Enhanced form validation and user feedback
- Maintained all existing functionality (presets, form persistence, icon selection)

**User Experience Improvements**:
- Better visual hierarchy with clear sections
- Real-time feedback on volume calculations
- More intuitive form flow and button placement
- Cleaner, more professional appearance
- Improved accessibility with proper labeling

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/forms/container/ContainerFormRefactored.tsx`

**Status**: ✅ Complete and tested

### Container Form Preset Navigation Enhancement
**Implementation**: Enhanced preset loading workflow to show presets as a full-page overlay within the same popup modal.

**UX Changes**:
- **Load Preset Flow**: Clicking "Load Preset" now switches to a dedicated preset selection view instead of showing a dropdown
- **Back Navigation**: Added arrow-left back button in the header when viewing presets to return to the main form
- **Full-Page Layout**: Presets now display in a spacious full-page layout with larger cards and better visual hierarchy
- **Dynamic Header**: Header title and subtitle change contextually:
  - Form view: "Add New Container" / "Define the space you'll be shipping with."
  - Preset view: "Load Preset" / "Choose from saved containers or built-in presets."

**Technical Implementation**:
- Added `currentView` state management with 'form' | 'presets' views
- Enhanced `ContainerPresetManager` with `isFullPage` prop for layout adaptation
- Improved preset cards with larger icons (10x10 vs 8x8) and better spacing
- Added conditional back button with proper hover states
- Maintained all existing functionality while improving user flow

**User Experience Improvements**:
- More intuitive navigation flow between form and presets
- Better visual separation between different workflow stages
- Larger, more accessible preset selection interface
- Clear breadcrumb-style navigation with back button
- Improved mobile responsiveness with dedicated preset view

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/forms/container/ContainerFormRefactored.tsx`
- `src/components/forms/container/ContainerPresetManager.tsx`

**Status**: ✅ Complete and tested

### Auto-Save Preset Button Enhancement
**Implementation**: Redesigned "Save as Preset" functionality to auto-save current form values with improved visual feedback and duplicate prevention.

**Design Changes**:
- **Button Icon**: Changed from heart (❤️) to star (⭐) with yellow color scheme
- **Button State**: Greys out after successful save until form values change
- **Auto-Save**: Removes modal popup - saves directly on button click
- **Visual Feedback**: Button text changes to "Preset Saved" when successfully saved

**Technical Implementation**:
- Added duplicate preset detection by comparing all form field values against existing saved containers
- Implemented form change tracking to reset button state when values are modified
- Added auto-save functionality that generates preset name from container name + "Preset"
- Integrated with existing `useSavedContainers` hook for database persistence
- Added form validation to ensure container name is provided before saving

**User Experience Improvements**:
- Streamlined workflow - no additional modal or form fields required
- Clear visual feedback showing save status and preventing duplicate saves
- Automatic duplicate detection with user-friendly error messages
- Button becomes disabled/greyed until form values change, preventing unnecessary saves
- Simplified interaction model - single click to save preset

**Error Handling**:
- Shows alert if trying to save without a container name
- Displays error message when duplicate preset values are detected
- Provides feedback if save operation fails

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/forms/container/ContainerFormRefactored.tsx`

**Status**: ✅ Complete and tested
